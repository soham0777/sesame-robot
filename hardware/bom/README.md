# Bill of Materials

Every part required to assemble Sesame is cataloged here. Pick the wiring strategy that fits your parts bin, then follow the build flow in [docs/build-guide/README.md](../../docs/build-guide/README.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Amazon links below point to representative search results so you can choose local suppliers or equivalent listings. Pricing and availability change frequently. If you don't mind waiting shipping times you can also order direct from manufacturer for much lower rates.

## Power & Safety Notes

- Sesame needs at least 5 V at 3 A available at the rails. 
- **Lolin S2 Mini:** Can be powered via USB-C PD (5V/3A capable) for tethered operation, or via battery + buck converter.
- **Distro Board V3/V2:** Supports both USB-C PD (5V/3A) for tethered operation AND battery + buck converter. Included in all Sesame Build Kits.
- **Distro Board V1 (Legacy):** Cannot run on tethered USB-C power due to design limitations. Must use battery + buck converter for operation.
- When battery powering either build, route the pack through the rocker switch and buck converter before it touches the rails, mirroring the schematic in [docs/wiring-guide/README.md](../../docs/wiring-guide/README.md).
- **Never cut the factory battery connector off the pack.** Instead, create adapter pigtails using XT30 or JST RCY leads so the pack remains chargeable.
- A Bambu Lab 14500 7.4V 800mAh Li-ion battery fits the new stock battery cavity (V3 requires printing the new internal frame).
- **Always apply heat shrink tubing to connectors**. Be extremely careful when cutting and soldering battery connectors. If you are still using the legacy 10440 solution make sure the cells are removed during soldering.
